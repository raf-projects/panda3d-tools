### Bullets
- create collision shapes for bullet

### Enemy
- create movement patterns & updates for enemy
- create collision shapes for enemy
- random spawn point func
- fix periodic spawning

### Collision
- player VS enemy body
- player VS enemy shot
- enemy VS player bullet
- player VS obstacle / environment

### Brainstorm these
- storing enemy data in yaml to be read into the game for spawning
    - can use the yaml import methods made elsewhere
- how to implement enemy movement patterns, and make them unique per enemy
